This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles and its improved version. The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is not recommended because it can change unexpectedly between updates. It also misses the `-y` flag in the `apt-get` commands, which causes problems in non-interactive environments like CI/CD pipelines. The fixed version uses a specific Ubuntu image version and adds the `-y` flag for better reproducibility and automation.  For improved security and best practice, consider using a slimmer base image and multi-stage builds.
